main function - parses cla, then calls asm reader, imemin writer

.word support - check if address exists, if so change according to parameter, if not generate zeroed lines until necessary address exsits.

imemin writer - iterate over Instruction array, for each inst create hex line and write each line to imemin.txt

asm reader - reads .asm file line by line calls parser function, returns array of Instruction struct. handles label translation

instruction parser - recevies a line (after label translation) and parses it into Instruction struct.
