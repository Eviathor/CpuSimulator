"# CompOrgProj" 

This repo hosts code for two distinct executables: asm.exe and sim.exe.
Usage of these execs is via CLI, i.e.:

asm.exe program.asm imemin.txt dmemin.txt
sim.exe imemin.txt dmemin.txt diskin.txt irq2in.txt dmemout.txt regout.txt trace.txt hwregtrace.txt cycles.txt leds.txt display7seg.txt diskout.txt monitor.txt monitor.yuv

Where the actual assembly code supplied by the user (henceforth: the program) is loacted in program.asm, and the machine code generated by the asm.exe is located in imemin.txt.
Further explanation regarding each I/O file can be found in docs/isaproject_261121.pdf

To support easy development and debugging, the command line arguments are supplied via project configuration; however, at later stages of the development it became important to support differnet input/output locations and files, therefore usage of #defines within in main.c was made, i.e. use #define DISKTEST to alter the input/output files' locations to a directory that hosts disktest.asm instead of the generic program.asm (filenames generally don't change, except for the program's name). Caveat: since development was made mainly on one machine the non-default paths (i.e. for test programs such as disktest.asm) are not relative paths, rather their absolute paths from within my machine; this of course won't work for anyone else, so until relative paths are utilized (similarly to the convention used in the default paths) it is crucial to manually change each path before running other programs.
