This repo hosts code for two distinct executables: asm.exe and sim.exe.
Usage of these execs is via CLI, i.e.:

asm.exe program.asm imemin.txt dmemin.txt
sim.exe imemin.txt dmemin.txt diskin.txt irq2in.txt dmemout.txt regout.txt trace.txt hwregtrace.txt cycles.txt leds.txt display7seg.txt diskout.txt monitor.txt monitor.yuv

Where the actual assembly code supplied by the user (henceforth: the program) is loacted in program.asm, and the machine code generated by the asm.exe is located in imemin.txt.
Further explanation regarding each I/O file can be found in docs/isaproject_261121.pdf

To support easy development and debugging, the command line arguments are supplied via project configuration; however, at later stages of the development it became important to support differnet input/output locations and files, therefore usage of #defines within in main.c was made, i.e. use #define DISKTEST to alter the input/output files' locations to a directory that hosts disktest.asm instead of the generic program.asm (filenames generally don't change, except for the program's name).

current solution looks like this in Simulator:

and Assembler:

make sure you use #define <PROGRAM> "program", since the string value is used to determine the enitre path!
