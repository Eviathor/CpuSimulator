goal: draw a full circle on the monitor in radius R=MEM[0x100]

iterate over all pixels of the screen, for each pixel calculate:
	r^2 = px^2+py^2
then check if r^2 <= R^2: if yes, set white; else set black.

!note: it is possible to iterate over a quarter of the pixels, since the circle should be symmetrical across the x and y axis.

The received shape is a full circle.

pseudo code:

for (int x = -128; x <= 0; x++)
{
	for (int y = -128; y <= 0; y++)
	{
		r_2 = x^2 + y^2;
		if r_2 <= R^2
		{
			set_pixel(x,y,"white")
			set_pixel(x+128, y, "white")
			set_pixel(x+128, y+128, "white")
			set_pixel(x, y+128, "white")
		}
		else
		{
			set_pixel(x,y,"black")
			set_pixel(x+128, y, "black")
			set_pixel(x+128, y+128, "black")
			set_pixel(x, y+128, "black")
		}
	}
}
